# WebSecurityDemo
This project is a simple employee database application that is intentionally left exposed based on the 2013 OWASP top 10 web security vulnerabilities.

While this is a front facing employee database application, there is an obvious "developer section" that teaches you what these exploits are, how to take advantage of them, what the bad code looks like, and how to correctly fix that code to no longer have the exploit.

### Pre-req
You will need the latest version of XAMPP or a similar AMP server configuration to run this.
Leave all settings default (we will want the database to have the default root account of root and no password)

### Installation
1. Install the git repo on your machine
2. Configure your AMP server to properly point to your git repo location
3. In the Databaseinfo.txt file will be a query you can run to configure your sql database to have the proper table
